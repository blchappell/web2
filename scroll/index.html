Jaundice is the #1 reason why newborns are readmitted to hospitals worldwide. About 3 in 5 children have some degree of jaundice. For approximately 18% of babies, the condition is severe and requires treatment. Severe jaundice, when left untreated or ineffectively treated, can lead to severe brain damage, a condition called kernicterus, or death.</p>
